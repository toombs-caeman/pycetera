# ideas
* allow f-string unpacking just like tuple unpacking
    - perhaps use regex syntax, assigning named groups only
    
* expand lens concept to handle map/filter/reduce
    
* how allow loop ordering for pure nested loops to be dynamically rewritten
    
* reversable functions `__rcall__`
# rejected ideas
* symbolic math, see sympy
